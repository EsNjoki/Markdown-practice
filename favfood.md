I liike roasted potatoes and fried chicken. That is more like fries with chicken. Fried, roasted, baked...all potatoes are my guilt pleasure and chicken is not because why would it be while it is the number one recommended by doctors, nutritionists, bloggers, vloggers, youtubers, teachers, i think dentists too. I have to specify that the chicken must be kienyeji, you know it gives you the hopes of living longer. I'll eat roasted potatoes and chicken any day any time literally.
